== About me

I'm currently 1st-year Master student, advised by Prof. [https://nicsefc.ee.tsinghua.edu.cn/people/yu-wang/ Yu Wang]. Before that, I received my B.Eng. from the same department in Tsinghua University. 

I was fortunate to be a Research & Development intern at [https://www.momenta.cn/ Momenta] in 2018 Summer, working on the construction of the autonomous driving simulation system. Since September 2018, I have been working in the Robot Group of [https://nicsefc.ee.tsinghua.edu.cn/ NICS-EFC Lab], interested in Single-robot Intelligence and Multi-robot Collaboration. More specifically, I focus on Decentralized SLAM now, where "SLAM" is a type of algorithms that let robots know "where am I", and "decentralized" (or "distributed") refers to speeding up work and expanding application scenarios by running multiple robots simultaneously.
