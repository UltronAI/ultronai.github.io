== About me

I'm currently a senior student at the Department of Electronic Engineering, Tsinghua University, where I'll continue to pursue my master degree, supervised by Prof. [https://nicsefc.ee.tsinghua.edu.cn/people/yu-wang/ Yu Wang]. I used to work in the labs of Prof. [http://oa.ee.tsinghua.edu.cn/ouzhijian/index.htm Zhijian Ou] and Prof. [http://fi.ee.tsinghua.edu.cn/~liyong/ Yong Li], engaged in Speaker Recognition and Mobile Data Mining respectively. And I was fortunate to be a Research & Development intern at [https://www.momenta.cn/ Momenta] in 2018 Summer, working on the construction of the autonomous driving simulation system. Since September 2018, I have been working in the Robot Group of [https://nicsefc.ee.tsinghua.edu.cn/ NICS-EFC Lab], interested in Single-robot Intelligence and Multi-robot Collaboration.
